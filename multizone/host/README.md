This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Example with different variants of fetching data. Includes static generation, dynamic request, revalidation on demand, time-based revalidation and client-side request

## Getting Started

First, run the development server, if you want to play with code:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

For testing different variants of fetching data:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Then:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
